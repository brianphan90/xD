1. How to trigger the event:
    - click mouse on any spot in the world

2. What should happen when the event is triggered:
    - a dog (Goodboi.java) will spawn in the middle of a field of flowers shaped in "XD"

3. What should the affected entities do:
    - Any obstacles surrounding the original flower spawn will turn into a flame that runs around eating ore
    - Any oreblobs that come into contact with the dog will be exploded and removed from the world

4. What the new entity is and how it should behave:
    - the dog that spawns will run around chasing ore blobs,
    and it will explode them upon contact and erase them from the world
    - obstacles surrounding the flower spawn will turn into moving flames that eat ore

5. Kelly Wong - created triggering of event + entity spawn + images editing/insertion
   Brian Phan - created new entities + actions of new entities on world
